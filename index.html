    <div class="intro">
      <p>What are hamsters, exactly? A hamster is a solitary burrowing rodent with a short tail and large cheek pouches
        for carrying food, native to Europe and Northern Asia. However, nowadays, they've been mostly domesticated and
        are kept as pets.</p>

  <div class="youwantone">

    <p>okay so by now you obviously want one</p>
    <h2>WHAT DO YOU NEED TO CARE FOR ONE??????????</h2>

    <p>
      Cages are the enclosures where you keep your hamster. However, it's easy to buy the cage the Petsmart employee
      recommends to you, but its usually far too small for a hamster. I'd recommend getting a minimum of 500 square
      inches of floorspace, but the more, the better. You can even buy an aquarium if you can. Make sure the cage is
      high enough to allow your hamster at least 5 inches of bedding for them to burrow.

    <h3>Entertainment</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="entertainment">
    <ul>
      <li>Wheel - At least 8 inches for a syrian hamster, 6 inches for a dwarf. DO NOT GET A FLYING SAUCER WHEEL FOR
        YOUR HAMSTER, OR A WIRED WHEEL! It can hurt them.</li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Wooden Chewing Toys - you can get them at Amazon, or even make your own using toilet paper rolls and a few
        treats to motivate them.</li>
      <p></p>

      <li>
        Bedding - Get wood chips, avoid pine and cedar woods, as they can cause respiratory issues among hamsters, or
        paper bedding. Get a lot of it - to get at least 5 inches evenly among the cage, you're gonna need a lot!</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="cage">
    <h3>Food</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="entertainment">
    <p>Buy a large, nutritious bag of hamster mix on a website or in a store like Amazon. Avoid those that are entirely
      pellets- try to find varied ones, with a mix of grains. Also, be sure to feed your hamster with lots of fresh
      vegetables and the occasional fruit! Always look up whether or not hamsters can consume a food before giving it to
      them.</p>
